# JAGS wfComboPack module

The JAGS wfComboPack module is an extension for JAGS that implements 7
deterministic functions representing different decision strategies:

  - Take-the-best (TTB)
  - TALLY
  - TALLYk
  - Weighted Additive (WADD)
  - kReason
  - randomWalk
  - generalAccumulator


### Take-the-best (TTB)

`TTB` returns a two-choice decision based on the Take-The-Best model

#### Usage
```cpp
TTB(stimA, stimB, s)
```

#### Arguments (3)
* **stimA:** a vector that for a set of cues defines whether a cue is present for *stimulus A* yes (coded as **1**), or no (coded as **0**)
* **stimB:** a vector that for a set of cues defines whether a cue is present for *stimulus B* yes (coded as **1**), or no (coded as **0**)
* **s:** the order of the validities in ascending order (index highest validity first, index lowest validity last)


##### Output (2)
* **choice:** **1** if *stimulus A* is chosen, **0** if *stimulus B* is chosen, and **0.5** if neither is chosen
